# The blind side
It is mainly talk about a black child without family adopted by a friendly family. At first, He can't communicate with others students normally. A scene moves me a lot that when he looks two girls are having a swing,maybe he wants to join them ,but the two little girls so scared and 
run away. This terrible situation stopped when lianni give him a hand. This woman not only warm his life but also give him a home. I am not harbor the idea that this moive's topic is Michael have the astonishing ability of protection and make a great achievement in football . I pour 
attention into the change, the family's unselfish love for the strange boy. When i see him having a swing with two children and have a normal university life, I really get satisfication. Of course, I know this boy just the lucky one out of many unlucky presons. But we have to know 
all man are created equal.
